# MINI PROJECTS

This repository is a collection of my own small, finished projects where I try out different concepts to better understand them in practice.

### Structure

The repository consists of a list of folders, each containing a different project. Inside a project directory, there will be one or several folders named after the language/framework used, with some consisting of several ones if the project has mixed codebase.

Each implementation has its own README.md file, which provides details about that specific implementation and highlights interesting aspects of the project.

[This](https://github.com/UndefFox/MiniProjects/tree/master/1.%20Snowfall) project was my first experience writing a small console application to explore basic concepts: receiving UNIX signals and handling them properly, retrieving input parameters in the standard way (getopt), and processing them.
